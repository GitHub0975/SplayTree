Teams that exceed the Competitive Balance Tax for one year must pay a 20 percent tax on the overage, 30 percent in year two and 50 percent in each subsequent year such as the Dodgers currently. But if you dip below it for one year, that figure resets. This could be significant in regards to next year's free-agent class, which is set to feature the likes of Bryce Harper and Manny Machado. By getting under the threshold, the Dodgers are saving money they would have paid on the overage that they can put toward next year's class, and also "resetting" their tax penalty.

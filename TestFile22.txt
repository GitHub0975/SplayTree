"CC feels there's unfinished business to attend to," said Sabathia's agent, Kyle Thousand of Roc Nation Sports. "There were competitive offers that CC was weighing, but in the end, CC wanted to come back and win a championship with the Yankees. He loves his teammates, the clubhouse and the moves the Yankees are making. He wants to bring home another championship to the Yankee fans."
